MVVM pattern

Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform.

Architectural pattern
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context. The architectural patterns address various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance limitations, high availability and minimization of a business risk. Some architectural patterns have been implemented within software frameworks.



Mediator pattern
+++++++++++++++++++++

In software engineering, the ``mediator pattern`` defines an object that ``encapsulates`` how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a ``behavioral pattern`` due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.

With the ``mediator pattern``, communication between objects is encapsulated within a mediator object. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing ``coupling``.



Business logic
++++++++++++++++

In computer software, ``business logic`` or ``domain logic`` is the part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed. It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a database or displaying the user interface, system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.
