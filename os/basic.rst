Operating System
===================


- Introduction to Operating Systems (OS)

  - Role, purpose and design issues

- Processes and Threads

  - OS structures, process control, abstractions, kernel/user modes and operations, context switching, interrupts

- Inter-Process Communication
  
  - Message passing IPC, RPC, layers, interfaces, hierarchies

- Coordination: Deadlocks

  - Process coordination, critical sections, deadlock characterization, deadlock detection and recovery, deadlock avoidance

- Scheduling/Resource Management

  - Task ordering, preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling, schedulers and policies, OS implementations

- Concurrency: Races, Mutual Exclusions

  - Critical sections, races, spin locks, synchronization

- Programming Abstractions: Semaphores

  - Semaphores, Monitors

- Memory Management

  - Storage structures, management/replacements approaches, virtual memory, paging, caching, segmentation

- I/O 

  - Device management, drivers, segmentation, interrupt handling, DMA

- File systems
  
  - File systems requirements, design and implementation, file structures, directories, naming, partitions, virtual file systems

- Fault Tolerance/Resilience
  
  - Fault types, fault handling approaches, reliable message delivery, OS reliability and availability, security issues

- Embedded/RT OS

  - Memory/disk/performance management, recovery, fault-tolerances, real-time aspects

- Distributed OS

  - Distributed computation and communication abstractions, synchronization, coordination, consistency

- Virtual Machines
  
  - Purpose and types of virtualization, virtual file systems, Hypervisors
