Coupling
^^^^^^^^

Coupling is the measure of the degree of interdependence between the modules. A good software will have low coupling.


- Types of Coupling (Best -> Worst)

  - Data Coupling
  - Stamp Coupling
  - Control Coupling
  - External Coupling
  - Common Coupling
  - Content Coupling



Cohesion
^^^^^^^^

Cohesion is a measure of the degree to which the elements of the module are functionally related. It is the degree to which all elements directed towards performing a single task are contained in the component. Basically, cohesion is the internal glue that keeps the module together. A good software design will have high cohesion.


- Functional Cohesion
- Sequential Cohesion
- Communicational Cohesion
- Procedural Cohesion
- Temporal Cohesion
- Logical Cohesion
- Coincidental Cohesion
