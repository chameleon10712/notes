Restore Commit
=================

1. ``git log`` to find out the commit you want to revert

2. ``git push origin +7f6d03:master`` while 7f6d03 is the commit before the wrongly pushed commit. + was for force push


This repo still exists because of this.

差點因為 ``git push -f`` 把這個 repo 蓋掉了 orz

好險還救的回來
