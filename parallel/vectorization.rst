Vectorization
================


-fvectorize, -fno-vectorize
-----------------------------

Enables or disables the generation of Advanced SIMD (NeonÂ®), M-profile Vector Extension (MVE), and Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) vector instructions directly from C or C++ code at optimization levels -O1 and higher.



- At optimization level ``-O2`` and above, the default is ``-fvectorize``. Use ``-fno-vectorize`` to disable automatic vectorization.
