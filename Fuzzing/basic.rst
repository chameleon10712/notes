Compiler sanitizers
---------------------

Sanitizers are tools that can detect bugs such as buffer overflows or accesses, dangling pointer or different types of undefined behavior.

The two compilers that mainly support sanitizing options are ``gcc`` and ``clang``. These options are passed to the compiler as flags and, depending on if you are using ``clang`` or ``gcc``, different sanitizers are supported.

Others
