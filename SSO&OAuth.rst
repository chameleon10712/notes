Difference Between SSO and OAuth

`OAuth is not Single Sign-On
<https://stormpath.com/blog/oauth-is-not-sso>`_



**OAuth** is an ``authorization protocol``.

**SSO** is an ``authentication / authorization flow`` through which a user can log into multiple services using the same credentials.

For instance, at your company, you might want to use one set of credentials to access:

- Your internal company website.
- Your Salesforce account.
- Your Atlassian account.
- etc.

Instead of making each employee at your company create different accounts for each of those services they use all the time, you can instead create a single account for each employee that grants them access to all of your company services.

This is SSO.
