Mixin
-------

In ``object-oriented programming languages``, a ``mixin`` (or ``mix-in``) is a class that contains methods for use 
by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. 
How those other classes gain access to the mixin's methods depends on the language. 
Mixins are sometimes described as being "included" rather than "inherited".

Mixins encourage code reuse and can be used to avoid the inheritance ambiguity 
that multiple inheritance can cause(the "``diamond problem``"),
or to work around lack of support for multiple inheritance in a language.
A mixin can also be viewed as an interface with implemented methods. 
This pattern is an example of enforcing the ``dependency inversion principle``.
