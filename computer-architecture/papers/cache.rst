Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC)

Jump to navigationJump to search
Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) is a page replacement algorithm with better performance than LRU (least recently used). 
This is accomplished by keeping track of both frequently used and recently used pages plus a recent eviction history for both. 
The algorithm was developed at the IBM Almaden Research Center. In 2006, IBM was granted a patent for the adaptive replacement cache policy
