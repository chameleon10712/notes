Programming Paradigms 程式設計範式
================================


- Imperative (procedural) 指令式程式設計

  - Machine Languages, FORTRAN, BASIC, C, Pascal
  - defines the programming process to be the development of a sequence of commands

|
- Declarative 宣告式程式設計

  - asks a programmer to describe the problem to be solved rather than an algorithm to be followed

|

- Object-oriented 物件導向程式設計

  - Java, C++, Visual Basic, C#
  - The object-oriented approach to a problem is to identify the objects involved and describe them as selfcontained units. 
|
- Functional 

  - LISP, Haskell
  - 比起指令式編程，函數式編程更加強調程式執行的結果而非執行的過程


|
- Generic programming 泛型程式設計


primitive data type 原始型別
----------------------------

- 也有稱作內建型別、基礎型別或者基本型別
- char, int, float


Composite data type
-------------------

- or compound data type
- struct (C/C++)



processor
---------

concurrency
-----------

- In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. 


process & thread
----------------


generic
template
uml
sequence diagram
deadlock prevent
validation & verification
js concurrency


- weak type 優缺
- 優
- 缺: may perform implicit type conversion at runtime

Computer Hardware
=================

- Processor

  - Concepts

    - Clock
    - Cache
    - Bus (FSB and BSB): Collection of wires connecting differenet devices
    - Pipeline: Implementation technique wehre multiple instructions are overlapped

  - Mesure Performance

    - Clock speed
    - type of microprocessor, the bus architecture, and the nature of the instruction set, all make a difference
      - examples : P4 3.06 GHz, P4 3.0B GHz, P4 3.0C GHz

- RAM
- Motherboard
- HardDisk
- Cards
- Ports
- BIOS
- Peripherals
- Cabinet
