Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
======================================

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** (CORS) is an **HTTP-header** based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

An example of a cross-origin request: the front-end JavaScript code served from

``https://domain-a.com`` uses XMLHttpRequest to make a request for ``https://domain-b.com/data.json``.
