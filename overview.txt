Programming Paradigms 程式設計範式


Imperative (procedural) 指令式程式設計
    - Machine Languages, FORTRAN, BASIC, C, Pascal
    - defines the programming process to be the development of a sequence of commands

Declarative 宣告式程式設計
    - asks a programmer to describe the problem to be solved rather than an algorithm
to be followed

Object-oriented 物件導向程式設計
    - Java, C++, Visual Basic, C#
    - The object-oriented approach to a problem is to identify the objects involved and describe them as selfcontained units. 
    
Functional 
    - LISP, Haskell
    - 比起指令式編程，函數式編程更加強調程式執行的結果而非執行的過程

concurrency
- In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome.
