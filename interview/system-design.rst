- Reverse Proxy
  
  - A proxy server is a goâ€‘between or intermediary server that forwards requests for content from multiple clients to different servers across the Internet. 
    A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. 
    A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.
